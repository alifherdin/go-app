## <pre>Hello!   \ (•◡•) /</pre>

### This is the repo of an application made using Go just for the purpose of exploring the languange, frameworks, and anything else I have in mind – or you could say – my personal playground.

#### This repo hosts a web back-end application *at first* as that's what I thought when creating this. Future plans? Who knows.
